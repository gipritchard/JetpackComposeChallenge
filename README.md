## :scroll: Description
This Jetpack Compose Android app allows you to see local video game doggos who need a home!

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
One of the coolest part of Jetpack Compose is how you can declare your @Composable functions inside of files separate from your Activity/Fragment Code. You can build your views with reuse in mind!
